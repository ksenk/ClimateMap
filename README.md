## Inspiration

From July 8th to July 11th, developers, data scientists, technology professionals, researchers, experts, academics and all weather data enthusiasts are invited to explore the near universal influence of environmental factors like weather and climate on Canadians using the data collected and generated by ECCC-MSC.

In consideration of Climate Change and to encourage the meaningful and productive use of earth science data, METEOHACK aims to inspire:

The Earth and Us: Combine Earth Science data and/or meteorological/climate data with sociological and/or economic information to generate new understandings and perspectives on human-environment interactions.
